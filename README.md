<p align="center">URL shorting service: <a href="https://nicofy.vercel.app/">Nicofy</a> </p>

## General info

This is an old project I made back in 2017 when I was learning about backend frameworks and databases. It's made with Python and Flask, using MySQL as database.

It allows you to short long URLs by generating a short ID that then redirects to the long URL.

## Demo version

This demo uses **Vercel** to host the backend service, and **PlanetScale** to host the database.

**You can visit the demo version at [Nicofy demo version](https://nicofy.vercel.app/)**
